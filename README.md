Differential Pricing Consultation Paper by TRAI
===============================================

In December 2015, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) floated a
consultation paper requesting comments on differential pricing of data
services. Differential pricing means charging different prices for data
depending on the source and nature of data and comes under the broader concept
of network neutrality. The consultation paper saw a huge number of responses,
from individuals, academicians, corperates and member of the civil society. The
consultation resulted in a regulation which prohibited differential pricing.

The code in this repository collects all the comments, counter comments and the
final regulation in a [single
pdf](https://github.com/hargup/diff_pricing_cp/raw/master/diff_pricing_cp.pdf).
This is important for curation and can also help in deciding regulations in
other jurisdictions.
